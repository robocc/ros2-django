# ros2-django

![Bring django power into your ROS2 worskpace](./img/logo.png)

This project is a Django application that aims to be integrated in a ROS2 python module.

The ROS2 module will then be able to start a node that will export CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) ROS services
for Django models.

The goal is to have a way to easily store and retrieve structured data in a ROS2 ecosystem via services, with the
power of django framework that includes schema migration, admin interface, field validation, and many more.
